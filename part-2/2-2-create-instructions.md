# Agent instructions (**2_instructions.py**)

As we saw in the first agent example, the instructions to the agent were not very helpful in getting the agent to behave. If anything it would suggest to the LLM that it should refrain from answering sometimes, because it says so in the instructions: *I'm a bot and I don't know anything*

The agent instructions are a very powerful way in getting our agent to behave and infuse it with knowledge it was not previously trained on. Sometimes it is to steer it in the right direction. Prompt engineering is not only a skill to apply to prompts, but also to agent instructions.

Check the [instructions.txt](./code/instructions.txt) file and feel free to change some instructions to see how the agent behaves. Make sure to revert the changes, because we will rely on this **instructions.txt** in the later examples.
