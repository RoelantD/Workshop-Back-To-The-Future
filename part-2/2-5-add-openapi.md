# Adding an OpenAPI spec (**5_full_file_search.py**)

Now we're going to enhance our agent with the ability to call external APIs using OpenAPI specifications. This powerful feature allows our agent to interact with real-world services, making it more practical and capable of performing actual business operations.

In this step, we'll add an OpenAPI tool that enables our agent to:
- Update instructions.txt with your own random user GUID and name
- Retrieve current betting opportunities
- Place bets on football matches

## Understanding OpenAPI Tools

OpenAPI tools allow agents to call external REST APIs by providing a structured specification (swagger.json) that describes:
- Available endpoints
- Required parameters
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication methods

The agent uses this specification to understand how to make proper API calls when needed.

## The Swagger Specification

Let's first examine our **swagger.json** file that defines the betting API:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.4",
  "info": {
    "title": "Cloudland.Workshop.Sports.API",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://app-betting-api.azurewebsites.net/api",
      "description": "Production server"
    }
  ],
  "paths": {
    "/api/bet": {
      "post": {
        "operationId": "PlaceBet",
        "requestBody": {
          "content": {
            "application/json": {
              "schema": {
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/BetRequest"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "/api/betting-opportunity": {
      "get": {
        "operationId": "GetCurrentBettingOpportunity"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This specification defines two key endpoints:
- **GET /api/betting-opportunity**: Retrieves current betting opportunities
- **POST /api/bet**: Places a bet with specific parameters

### Additional Imports

First, we need to import the necessary modules for OpenAPI functionality:

```python
import jsonref
from azure.ai.agents.models import OpenApiTool, OpenApiAnonymousAuthDetails
```

- `jsonref`: Handles JSON reference resolution in OpenAPI specs
- `OpenApiTool`: The tool class for OpenAPI integration
- `OpenApiAnonymousAuthDetails`: Handles authentication (anonymous in our case)

### Loading the OpenAPI Specification

We load and parse our swagger.json file:

```python
############################
# OpenApiTool
############################
with open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "/part-2/code/swagger.json"), "r") as f:
        openapi_betting_api = jsonref.loads(f.read())

openapi_tool = OpenApiTool(
    name="betting_api", 
    spec=openapi_betting_api, 
    description="Place bets, retrieve betting options, and check bet status", 
    auth=OpenApiAnonymousAuthDetails()
)
```

**Key components:**
- **name**: A unique identifier for this API tool
- **spec**: The parsed OpenAPI specification 
- **description**: Helps the agent understand when to use this tool
- **auth**: Authentication method (anonymous for this demo)

### Enhanced Toolset

Now our toolset includes three types of tools:

```python
############################
# Creating the toolset
############################
toolset = ToolSet()
toolset.add(file_search)      # Knowledge base search
toolset.add(openapi_tool)     # External API calls
toolset.add(functions)        # Custom Python functions
project_client.agents.enable_auto_function_calls(toolset)
```

This gives our agent a comprehensive set of capabilities:
1. **File search**: Query the knowledge base from documents
2. **OpenAPI tool**: Call external betting APIs
3. **Function tool**: Execute custom Python logic

## Testing Your Enhanced Agent

Start the **5_full_file_search.py** script and try these interactions:

### 1. Get Betting Opportunities
```
You: What betting opportunities are currently available?
```

The agent should call the `GetCurrentBettingOpportunity` endpoint and return the available matches.

### 2. Place a Bet
```
You: I want to place a bet on the next match. I think the home team will win.
```

The agent should:
1. First get current betting opportunities
2. Ask for additional details if needed (amount, user ID)
3. Call the `PlaceBet` endpoint with the proper parameters

### 3. Combined Intelligence
```
You: Based on the character knowledge and my prediction function, what would Biff Tannen bet on?
```

This tests the agent's ability to:
1. Search the knowledge base about Biff Tannen
2. Use the predict_winner function
3. Potentially place a bet via the API

## Understanding the Agent's Decision Making

The agent automatically decides which tools to use based on:
- **User intent**: What the user is asking for
- **Tool descriptions**: How each tool is described
- **Context**: Previous conversation and available data

For example:
- Questions about characters → File search tool
- Prediction requests → Function tool  
- Betting actions → OpenAPI tool
- Complex requests → Multiple tools in sequence

## Key Benefits of OpenAPI Integration

1. **Real-world connectivity**: Agent can interact with actual services
2. **Standardized interface**: OpenAPI specs provide clear contracts
3. **Automatic discovery**: Agent understands available operations from the spec
4. **Error handling**: Built-in validation and error responses
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add more APIs by providing additional specs

## Exercise: Enhance the Betting Logic

Try modifying the `predict_winner` function to:
1. Call your ML model endpoint from Part 1
2. Use the actual prediction to influence betting decisions
3. Consider the betting odds when making recommendations

This will create a more sophisticated agent that combines:
- Machine learning predictions
- Knowledge base information  
- Real API interactions
- Business logic

## Troubleshooting

You can check the logs folder for the output of the agent so you can inspect the tool calls to the API.

Your agent now has the full spectrum of capabilities - from knowledge retrieval to API integration to custom business logic!
