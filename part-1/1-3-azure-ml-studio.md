# Create Machine Learning Workspace and Compute Resources
To work with Azure Machine Learning, you need to [create a workspace](/part-1/1-create-ml-workspace.md). Follow the instructions to create the workspace interactively using Azure Portal.

If you are a developer and prefer doing things via code, you can also create a workspace through command-line or through Python SDK. This workshop assumes you will create it through the portal.

After you have created the workspace, open it in Azure Machine Learning Studio

Then, you need to [create a compute instance](/part-1/1-create-ml-compute-instance.md), this is a virtual machine that you can use to run Jupyter notebooks, a tool that many data scientists use. We will use it in order to test our model towards the end of the module.

While these resources are being created, we are going to explore some machine learning concepts.
